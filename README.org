#+TITLE: conceal

Don't you hate when people accidentally get to see your precious private content
while you screen share? Don't you get nightmares realizing that the meeting was
being recorded?

Conceal helps you hide private views while sharing screen in this era of remote
work.

** Emacs
For emacs, there is a minor mode in =conceal.el= that conceals the buffer in which
it is enabled. Here is an example config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Enable conceal mode on .org.gpg files
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (when (conceal-buffer-gpg-p (current-buffer))
                (conceal-mode 1))))
#+end_src

Here is a screen showing my concealed medical journal.
